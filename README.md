###### AWS-IoT-Over-the-Air(OTA)-Firmware-Update-for-IoT-Devices**

### Project Summary:
This project enables over-the-air (OTA) firmware updates for IoT devices using AWS services, specifically AWS IoT Core and S3. The guide walks through the setup of AWS IoT Core for device management, the configuration of an S3 bucket to host firmware files, and the creation of a job to push firmware updates to IoT devices. It also includes steps for monitoring the update process and validating the firmware update.

---

### Step 1: Set Up AWS IoT Core

#### 1.1 Create an IoT Thing
- Go to the **AWS IoT Core** console.
- Navigate to **Manage** > **Things** and click **Create**.
- Select **Create a single thing**.
- Provide a unique name for your IoT device (e.g., `Your_IoT_Device`).
- Complete the Thing creation process.

#### 1.2 Create a Certificate for the IoT Thing
- After creating the IoT thing, you will be prompted to create a certificate.
- Click **Create certificate**.
- Download the following files:
  - **Device certificate** (e.g., `Your_Device_Certificate.pem.crt`)
  - **Private key** (e.g., `Your_Private_Key.pem.key`)
  - **Amazon root CA** (e.g., `AmazonRootCA1.pem`)
- These files will be used in your Python script to authenticate the device when connecting to AWS IoT Core.

#### 1.3 Attach a Policy to the Certificate
- In the **AWS IoT Core** console, go to **Secure** > **Policies** and click **Create**.
- Provide a unique name for the policy (e.g., `Your_IoT_Policy`).
- Add the necessary policy permissions to allow the device to interact with AWS IoT Core.
- Attach the policy to the IoT device certificate by selecting the certificate and clicking **Attach policy**.

#### 1.4 Create the IoT Job Topic
- Go to **AWS IoT Core** > **Act** > **Jobs**.
- Note the job topic format: `$aws/things/{thingName}/jobs/notify-next`. This topic is used to listen for job notifications.

### Step 2: Set Up AWS S3 for Firmware Storage

#### 2.1 Create an S3 Bucket
- Go to the **AWS S3** console.
- Click **Create bucket** and provide a unique name (e.g., `your-bucket-name`).
- Ensure the bucket is in the same AWS region as your IoT device and IoT Core.
- Click **Create**.

#### 2.2 Upload the Firmware File to S3
- In the S3 bucket you just created, click **Upload**.
- Select the firmware file you want to use for the update (e.g., `your-firmware-file-v1.2.bin`).
- Click **Upload** to upload the firmware to S3.

#### 2.3 Set Permissions for the Firmware
- Click the uploaded firmware file in your S3 bucket.
- Under the **Permissions** tab, ensure that the object is publicly accessible or that it has the appropriate IAM role permissions for the IoT device to access it.

---

### Step 3: Create or Modify the OTA Job Document

#### 3.1 Modify the Job Document
Ensure the OTA job document contains the correct information for the update, including:
- The URL of the firmware file hosted in your S3 bucket.
- The version number of the firmware update.

---

### Step 4: Create a New Job in AWS IoT Core

#### 4.1 Navigate to the AWS IoT Console
- Go to **Manage** > **Jobs** and click **Create job**.
- Select **Create custom job**.
- Provide a unique job name (e.g., `IoT-OTA-Job-v1.2`).
- Add the target device:
  - Select your Thing (e.g., `Your_IoT_Device`).
- Upload the job document or paste the job details in the appropriate format.
- Complete the job creation process.

---

### Step 5: Monitor the Update Process

#### 5.1 Check Python Script Output
- The Python script you provided will be listening to the job notifications.
- If everything is configured correctly, the script should detect the job notification on the subscribed topic (e.g., `$aws/things/Your_IoT_Device/jobs/notify-next`) and process it.
- The script will download the new firmware to the local directory where the script is running.

---

### Step 6: Validate the Update

#### 6.1 Verify Firmware Download
After the update completes:
- Verify that the new firmware has been downloaded to the local directory.
- Check the console logs for confirmation messages about the download and job processing.

---

### Final Notes:
This guide provides detailed instructions for setting up the AWS IoT environment, creating an OTA job, uploading firmware to S3, and validating the update. By following these steps, you will be able to implement OTA updates for your IoT devices using AWS IoT Core and S3.
