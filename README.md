# Real-Time-OTA-updates-with-AWS-IoT
This project implements Over-the-Air (OTA) firmware updates for IoT devices using AWS IoT Core and Python. It simulates an IoT device that connects to AWS IoT Core, subscribes to job notifications, and downloads firmware from S3 when triggered, enabling secure and automated device updates.
